**Simulation and evaluation of novel hybrid and other advanced energy conversion systems (including polygeneration)**

To meet global energy sustainability goals, future energy policies must promote a clean-energy economy based on renewable energy resources and advanced, highly-efficient energy systems. In many cases, however, individual clean-energy options present disadvantages in terms of efficiency, cost and operation. In contrast, hybrid energy systems, which employ more than one energy input, increase operating efficiency, energy security and reliability. Meanwhile, polygeneration technologies, i.e., facilities co-generating three or more useful energy products, reduce risks by providing more flexible and consistent operation and can result in cost savings. 

In this work, we realize dynamic simulations of complex plants to sattisfy restrictions and requirements of specific regions. The simulations account for 

Combination of energy resources and technologies: Natural gas, RES (solar thermal and PV, wind, geothermal, hydropower), desalination, heat pumps, refrigeration units, electrolysis, fuel cells, wastewater treatment
Products: power, thermal energy, water, salt
