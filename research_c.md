**Exergy-based methods for the optimization of energy systems: Application of thermodynamic, economic and environmental analyses for efficiency maximization and costs and environmental impact minimization**


Advanced exergetic, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses provide valuable information about how, and to what extent, changes in a component of a complex plant affect the operation, costs and environmental impacts of the remaining components of the plant and the operation and costs of the overall plant. In addition, these approaches reveal the real potential for improvement that can lead to plant optimization. Such results save engineering time and shed light onto the path of iterative optimization steps needed for optimizing the overall system. Although advanced exergy-based methods are a very valuable tool for the evaluation and optimization of complex energy systems (minimization of irreversibilities, cost and environmental impacts) and supplement conventional approaches, they suffer from some shortcomings that hinder their wider use. These shortcomings include the complexity of the application of the methods and uncertainty of specific theoretical aspects of the methods.
We are currently developing a method combining social environmental impacts with exergy-based methods relevant to develop a multicriteria tool for the more complete evaluation of energy systems.
