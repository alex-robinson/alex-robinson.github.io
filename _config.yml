  I received my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering
  (Technical University of Crete, 2005) and my Ph.D. in Energy Engineering
  (Technical University of Berlin, 2010). I conducted my Ph.D. and
  post-doctoral research activities holding European Fellowships.

  My work focuses on the energy autonomy of remote areas and the simulation
  and optimization of biofuel and zero-emission energy conversion processes.
  I am an expert on exergy-based methods and I am involved in the development
  of analytical methods for the optimization of complex energy systems.

  I have taught courses on heat transfer and the optimization of thermodynamic
  systems and have supervised a large number of bachelor and master theses.
  I have been honoured with a best paper award and my Ph.D. thesis was chosen
  as one the three best in Germany by RWE AG. I am the author of 22 journal articles,
  2 book chapters and have participated in various international conferences
  and workshops.
