- **EUROPEAN GRANTS FOR POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS (MARIE CURIE INDIVIDUAL FELLOWSHIPS)**

_Parties interested in applying for these highly competitive grants and fulfil the requirements of the call can email their CV to fpetrako@ing.uc3m.es as soon as possible._

The goal of the Individual Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative potential of experienced researchers, wishing to diversify their individual competence in terms of skill acquisition through advanced training, international and intersectoral mobility. Individual Fellowships provide opportunities to acquire and transfer new knowledge and to work on research and innovation in a European context (EU Member States and Associated Countries) or outside Europe. The scheme particularly supports the return and reintegration of researchers from outside Europe who have previously worked here. It also develops or helps to restart the careers of individual researchers that show great potential, considering their experience.
