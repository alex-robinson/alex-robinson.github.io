**Regional renewable energy autonomy for social and environmental benefits**

The European Union has committed to reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels by implementing energy-saving measures. The fast growth of renewable energy technologies presents a new opportunity, both financially and environmentally, to decarbonize regional energy systems. I am particularly interested in the study of 100% renewable-energy independence of energy- islands, in the sense of both real geographical islands and remote communities on the mainland with poor or no grid connection â€“ a topic highlighted by the two calls in Horizon 2020 (LC-SC3-ES-3-2018-2020 and LC- SC3-ES-4-2018-2020). Energy generation in remote regions is often costly due to inefficient infrastructure and/or the associated inefficiencies of energy conversion and transport. These high energy costs facilitate the incorporation of relatively more expensive, but environmentally friendlier energy technologies. In this way, remote regions can constitute poles of attraction of new independent and environmentally-friendly energy systems and storage technologies (such as batteries and electric vehicles), while they can also play an important role in the development of the wider region.
