I work on the simulation, evaluation and optimization of energy conversion processes
based both on conventional and renewable resources. 

I am particularly interested in:

- The simulation of novel hybrid and other advanced energy conversion systems (also for polygeneration),

- Estimation of present and future water use in conventional, renewable and hybrid power plants and water minimization strategies,

- Regional renewable energy autonomy for social and environmental benefits,

- The application of exergy-based thermodynamic, economic and environmental analyses for efficiency maximization and costs and environmental impact minimization and

- The development of new tools for power plant optimization.

I am always looking for motivated, creative and well qualified students and researchers to come work with me. I am open to new ideas and willing to support innovative and attractive proposals. Please feel free to contact me at fpetrako@ing.uc3m.es.
