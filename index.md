I am a tenure-track Professor (Ram√≥n y Cajal) at the Department Thermal and Fluid Engineering of the University Carlos III of Madrid. I am also currently leading the research line Water-Energy Nexus of the Department.

I received my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Crete (2005) and my Ph.D. in
Energy Engineering from the Technical University of Berlin (2010). I have worked as a researcher in Germany,
Spain and Greece holding European Fellowships (Marie-Curie Actions, 2006-2018).

My work focuses on the simulation and optimization of energy conversion processes using thermodynamic, economic and environmental criteria. The energy conversion processes I study include, among others, renewable- and fossil-based power plants,biofuel generation processes and zero-emission energy processes (including CO2 capture).

My research lines include:

- Energy islands: Regional renewable energy autonomy for social and environmental benefits,

- The Water-Energy Nexus: Estimation of present and future water use in conventional, renewable and hybrid power plants and   water minimization strategies,

- Simulation of novel hybrid and other advanced energy conversion systems (also for polygeneration),

- Exergy-based methods: Application of thermodynamic, economic and environmental analyses for efficiency maximization and costs and environmental impact minimization and

- Development of new tools for energy system optimization, automatization and digitalization of data.

I have taught courses on heat transfer and the optimization of thermodynamic systems and have supervised a large number of bachelor and master theses. I have been honoured with a best paper award and my Ph.D. thesis was chosen as one the three best in Germany by RWE AG. I am the author of various journal articles and book chapters and have participated in numerous international conferences and workshops.

According to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=LLgloUsAAAAJ&hl=en), my h-index is 16 and my i10-index is 21. According to [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36158603700) my h-index is 14.
