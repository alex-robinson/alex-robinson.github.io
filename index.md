I work on the simulation, evaluation and optimization of energy conversion processes
based both on conventional and renewable resources.
I am particularly interested in:

- The simulation of novel hybrid energy conversion systems (also for polygeneration),

- The investigation of regional energy autonomy for social and environmental
benefits,

- The application of exergy-based thermodynamic, economic and environmental
analyses for efficiency maximization and costs and
environmental impact (including water usage) minimization and

- The development of new tools for power plant optimization.
