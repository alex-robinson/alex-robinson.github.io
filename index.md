Research focus
----

I am researcher at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid since July 2015.

I am particularly interested in:

- The simulation of novel advanced energy conversion
systems,

- The application of thermodynamic, economic and environmental
analyses
for maximizing the operational efficiency, minimizing costs and
environmental impacts (including water usage) and the development of new tools
for power plant optimization.
