**OPTIHYP** proposed and evaluated novel integrated hybrid-polygeneration systems to support the 
sustainable energy development of European regions, as well as link strategic energy planning with 
European policies, social considerations and environmental impacts. Renewable and conventional energy sources 
were coupled in advanced systems that incorporated both new and conventional energy conversion technologies. 
These systems were optimized based on efficiency maximization and the minimization of water usage, environmental impacts and costs.
