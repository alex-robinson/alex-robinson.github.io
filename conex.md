OPTIHYP will propose and evaluate novel integrated hybrid-polygeneration systems to support the 
sustainable energy development of European regions, as well as link strategic energy planning with 
European policies, social considerations and environmental impacts. Renewable and conventional energy sources 
will be coupled in advanced systems that incorporate both new and conventional energy conversion technologies. 
These systems will be optimized using an innovative multi-criteria method focused on efficiency maximization 
and the minimization of water usage, environmental impacts and costs. Thermodynamic, economic, environmental 
and water usage estimates will be used to create two original databases. This inter-disciplinary project will 
produce the first open-access, flexible online tool for regional energy planning based on hybrid-polygeneration 
systems. This web-based tool will be made available to the scientific community, policymakers and the private 
sector and will lay the foundation for robust optimization strategies in the energy sector.
