Green ENERGy for ISlands (GENERGIS) studied and reported paths towards the renewable energy autonomy of Skyros island in Greece.
The goals of the project were to:
(1) address the energy autonomy of the island, including energy storage systems,
(2) involve the people of the community in the decision-making process,
(3) perform detailed technical calculations through simulations, as well as exhaustive economic and environmental analyses,
(4) propose a concrete energy plan for achieving 100% sustainable living,
(5) create the first guide on sustainable development based on social, environmental and economic data.
