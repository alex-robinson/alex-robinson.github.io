The incorporation of fuel cells into power plants can enhance the operational efficiency and facilitate 
the separation and capture of emissions. This project studies the incorporation of a fuel-cell unit, 
consisting of solid-oxide fuel-cell stacks, a pre-reformer, and an afterburner into a combined-cycle power plant 
with CO2 capture from an economic and environmental point of view. The thermodynamic performance of the plant, 
previously examined using an exergetic analysis, will herewith be combined with an economic analysis and a life 
cycle assessment to realize exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses. The work will include sensitivity analyses 
to reveal the range of economically and environmentally viable scenarios.
