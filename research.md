I work on the design, simulation, evaluation and optimization of energy conversion systems. My main focus is to evaluate critical environmental issues in the energy sector and propose innovative solutions to address them effectively. I believe that in order to limit the environmental impacts of increasing global energy use and decrease the stress imposed on the climate, we need drastic changes in our present energy practices. With this in mind, I like working on research projects, the realization of which would demand a radical shift from the established business-as-usual situation. The comparison of these types of proposals with currently-existing cases, as well as analysis of economic viability and environmental sustainability, has always been an integral part of my work. 

My research lines are:

A) [Simulation and evaluation of advanced energy conversion systems](http://fontina-petrakopoulou.github.io/researchlineA/) 

B) [Regional renewable energy autonomy](http://fontina-petrakopoulou.github.io/researchlineB/)

C) [Exergy-based methods for the optimization of energy systems](http://fontina-petrakopoulou.github.io/researchlineC/)

D) [The water-energy-climate nexus](http://fontina-petrakopoulou.github.io/researchlineD/)

E) [Automatization of existing and development of new optimization tools](http://fontina-petrakopoulou.github.io/researchlineE/)
