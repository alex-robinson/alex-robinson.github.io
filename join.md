I am looking for motivated students and researchers to come work with me and be part of a forward thinking research group. 
I am open to new ideas and I support innovative and attractive proposals. Contact me by e-mail with a CV and your research interests.


<!-- I am looking for enthusiastic students and postdocs to work with me in the Earth & Planetary Sciences department at UC Santa Cruz.

Research topics could include (but not limited to!):
- ice sheets, sea-level, and climate change
- solid Earth deformation over the ice age
- landscape evolution


Interested students should email Tamara Pico with a brief statement of research interests. In particular I would recommend the following:
1) Peruse this website and read about the different past and ongoing group research projects. To get a sense of what it is like to work in our group consider reading the Pico Group Manual.

2) Read 1-2 papers closely - it will be useful to know what topics you are interested in!

3) Write 1-2 short paragraphs describing your background and research interests, and mention any degrees you've earned.
